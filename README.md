# Sitecore-Company-Website

This is an example website made with Sitecore. All of the elements are dynamic (can be easily changed in Sitecore). The Connection is among Sitecore Items and MVC is made using GlassMapper

This was the main project that I worked on my internship at Nemetos. The Website is published on my PC
